Things to add: 
Better resume checking:
    Use pdf extract tool to extract all text then send it to LLM to save tokens
    First verify if a file is resume or not
    If true then proceed with extraction or it can happen in one go

Embedding models for question bank generation and better UX by using pgvector
Using supermemoryai to build a memory brain - add on feature

Fixing auto submit error at hard last question
