## Critical Path (Minimum Viable Product)

If time is constrained, focus on this critical path:

### Must-Have (MVP):

1. ✅ Auth (login/register)
2. ✅ Question generation (AI)
3. ✅ Create interview
4. ✅ Upload resume & extract fields
5. ✅ Take interview (6 questions with timers)
6. ✅ Submit answers
7. ✅ Evaluation (AI)
8. ✅ Results page (candidate)
9. ✅ Recruiter dashboard (view candidates & scores)
10. ✅ Deployment

### Nice-to-Have (If Time Permits):

- Question bank browser
- Regenerate specific questions
- Detailed candidate view with chat history
- Search/filter on dashboards
- Export results
- Real-time updates (Socket.io)
- Dark mode

### Can Skip for MVP:

- Redis caching
- Rate limiting
- Refresh tokens
- Email notifications
- Advanced analytics

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Blockers:

1. **AI API Rate Limits:** Use gpt-4o-mini where possible, cache responses
2. **Resume Parsing Accuracy:** Have manual field collection as fallback
3. **Timer Sync Issues:** Always trust server timestamp, validate on backend
4. **Deployment Issues:** Test deployment early (Day 5-6)
5. **Complex UI:** Use shadcn/ui for pre-built components

### Mitigation Strategies:

- Test AI integration early (Day 2)
- Build incrementally, test frequently
- Have fallback plans (e.g., manual question entry if AI fails)
- Use established libraries (TanStack, Hono) to avoid custom bugs
- Deploy to staging environment before final deployment

---



- [ ] Git commit regularly (feature branches)
